You can now press + to add friend. Please follow on-screen instructions to find friends using their Gmail address. If you already have some friends in your contact list, you can remove them from your phone by swiping with your finger to the left or right. Please note that your friend will have to accept your request in order for them to be added to your list.

![Friend request](images/request.png)

If you are logged in to the program and somebody wanted to add you to their friends list, you will be notified using Android notification. Please press OK to grant the request. They will be automatically added to your list as well.

![Following a friend](images/following.png)

When following a friend, their name will appear at the top of the screen. You can swipe this banner to stop following them. You can only follow one friend at a time.

When your device is stationary, no data is sent to the Internet to save data and battery power. You will still receive location updates from your friend.
